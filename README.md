C_memmove function

 Problem under study:

   The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest. The memory areas
   must not overlap. Letâ€™s assume that the prototype for memcpy() is:
   void memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

   The purpose of this exercise is to create an implementation of memcpy() that is robust to memory
   region overlapping. The function to implement will have the following prototype:
   void memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);
